<p class="problems">Problems Are Meant To Be Solved</p>
<p class="quote_styling">"I love solving problems!
  No problem is like the other, but there are some common denominators for all challenges. Solving problems will tend to be exciting, frustrating, rewarding, hard, fun, exhausting, stimulating, aggravating, healthy, educational and to a varying degree, groundbreaking, but it will never be boring.
  When done together in a group, I become even more engaged, and constructive feedback is invaluable in my opinion. When bouncing and discussing solutions, twisting and turning suggestions, and questioning what doesn't quite fit, that's how you polish rough diamonds. In all previous professional roles, the individual has been at the center of focus. When helping a student with math assignments, checking in a recurring guest, or a colleague in support, it is always a unique individual with their unique circumstances and needs who is requesting our service. To succeed in making the customer happy, we must first and foremost understand what is desired, and the best way for me to understand someone else is to listen very carefully to what is being said."</p>

      <p class="information">During my latest employment I was tasked with manning the first line support channel for the local county. Along with other assignments such as being responsible for all mobile phones within the organization, this included requisitioning phones and subscriptions for all different county departments while also managing them and their permissions through an MDM-tool. It is a challenging but rewarding experience. As the first point of contact for customers or clients who are experiencing technical issues, it is essential to have strong communication and problem-solving skills to help resolve their concerns in a timely and efficient manner. First line support involves dealing with a range of issues, from minor queries to complex technical problems, so it is crucial to have a good understanding of the company's products or services, as well as the ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies. In addition to technical expertise, first line support professionals must also have a friendly and empathetic attitude to provide a positive customer experience.</p>

      Concurrent with my time working at the school I was also employed at the local campsite at campsites has been a valuable experience that has taught me many important skills.
      One of the most important things that I've learned is how to effectively communicate with customers and handle customer service issues in order to ensure that campers have a positive experience and are able to enjoy their time spent with us.
      I've also learned how to multitask and manage a variety of responsibilities at once, such as answering phones, checking in guests, and handling reservations.
      It is an environment that demands you to be organized and detail-oriented while at the same time being adaptable and flexible accuracy is key when dealing with reservations and financial transactions.

      Working as an assitant teacher has been one of my most valuable experiences that has taught me many important skills. One of the most important things that I've learned is how to effectively communicate with both students and teachers.
      This has been crucial in ensuring that lessons are delivered clearly and that all students are able to understand the material. I've also learned how to manage a classroom and keep students on task, which has required me to develop strong organizational and time management skills.
      Additionally, working as a teacher's assistant has taught me the importance of being patient and empathetic with students, as everyone learns at their own pace and may face unique challenges. Overall, my experience as a teacher's assistant has been incredibly rewarding and has provided me with skills that I will be able to use throughout my life.

          I completed a three-year programme that covered a variety of technical skills in computing, networking, and electronics. <br><br>
          At the beginning of the programme, we were introduced to operating systems and programming concepts, including algorithms, data structures, and programming in C++ where we learned to write and debug rudimentary programs.
          In addition to this we also studied electronic devices at the integrated circuit level and learned about different logic gates and their uses.<br><br>
          In the web design course, we learned how to design and develop websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br><br>
          In the computer networking course, we learned about different types of networks, such as Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs), as well as Network Security. We learned how to configure and manage network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls.<br><br>
          The database management course introduced us to database systems design and implementation using relational database management systems such as Access and Microsoft SQL Server. <br><br>
          Throughout the program, I had the opportunity to work on several group projects and presentations, which helped me to develop my communication and teamwork skills.

            Have you ever pondered about the QWERTY-keyboard and how such a rudimentary tool plays a gargantuan important part is in keeping modern society stumbling along at its current rate? Almost everyone uses the QWERTY layout when typing, either as a virtual keyboard on your smartphone or a mechanical one on your desk, the idea is basically the same. "A tool for typing all the letters we use when using our language in written form" Considering that this tool is bordering on 150 years in active service, there must be room for improvement.  QWERTY is a real life relic from ancient times, this tool has been around since 1874. That is by modern standards an absolute dinosaur and I intend to make it extinct.

            While working remote in an agile framework, the routine of keeping a logbook is very cruical. The problem is that remembering to enter logs is for someone like me basically impossible, so in order to combat this flaw of mine I created a Power Automate flow and some Adaptive Cards that streamlines the process and reminds me about it every evening.
            Additionally when the log has been entered, the flow will give you an overview of tomorrows schedule together with an overview of tasks that are due soon. It helps keep me on the ball and I will develop this concept further when I have the time.

            When it comes to hanging pictures on the wall, I don't want anything you could find at IKEA or somewhere similar because it means everyone else will have it too, I want mine to be unique and have some reference to myself. Thats why I occasionally make my own in the hopes of one day having them printed. The dawn of AI has lit this fire once again, intensely. Tools like StableDiffusion can help me create the images I envision and will allow me to splice different images with much less effort, there will definetly be some new pictures made in the near future.

                          Gaming has been a hobby of mine since a very young age, and it has stayed with me to this day. As a child, I would spend hours playing classic games such as Super Mario and Tetris, and as I grew older, I moved on to more complex games and consoles. Gaming has not only provided me with hours of entertainment and fun but has also allowed me to stay up to date with much of the advancements in modern technology. As games have evolved, so has the technology needed to support them, and as a result, I have become familiar with various technologies such as high-speed internet, advanced graphics cards, and gaming peripherals. My passion for gaming has also led me to explore different genres of games, from strategy games to first-person shooters, and has helped me develop skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork. Overall, gaming has been an essential part of my life and has prepared me to thrive in an agile work environment.

                        Disc golf has been my go-to hobby for quite some time now. There's something about throwing a  disc accurately at the basket that I find incredibly satisfying. Disc golf has taught me the importance of patience, focus, and accuracy. It's also given me the opportunity to meet new people and be part of a supportive community of disc golf enthusiasts. Whether I'm playing a quick round with friends or practicing throwing from particular distances, disc golf always manages to lift my mood and help me recharge.
