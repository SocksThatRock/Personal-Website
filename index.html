        <p>Having spent the beginning of my career working with both customers and students as the focal point has given me a valuable set of skills in communication and understanding. Through these experiences, I have learned to be patient, empathetic, and adaptable in my approach to different individuals and situations. I believe that effective communication is essential in any interaction, and my experience has enabled me to hone my ability to listen actively and respond in a way that is clear, concise, and appropriate for the audience. With these skills together with my education and personal interests I am very well equipped to handle the challenge of delivering a high quality service.</p>

Along with other assignments such as being responsible for all mobile phones within the organization, this included requisitioning phones and subscriptions for all different county departments while also managing them and their permissions through an MDM-tool. It is a challenging but rewarding experience. As the first point of contact for customers or clients who are experiencing technical issues, it is essential to have strong communication and problem-solving skills to help resolve their concerns in a timely and efficient manner. First line support involves dealing with a range of issues, from minor queries to complex technical problems, so it is crucial to have a good understanding of the company's products or services, as well as the ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies. In addition to technical expertise, first line support professionals must also have a friendly and empathetic attitude to provide a positive customer experience.</p><br>

                  <div class="url_styling">üåê <a href="https://www.azeron.eu">Azeron</a></div>
                  <div class="info">
                    <br>
                    <img src="/images/1_a.jpg" width="300px"><br><br>
                    <p>Have you ever pondered about the QWERTY-keyboard and how such a rudimentary tool plays a gargantuan important part is in keeping modern society stumbling along at its current rate? Almost everyone uses the QWERTY layout when typing, either as a virtual keyboard on your smartphone or a mechanical one on your desk, the idea is basically the same. "A tool capable of typing all the letters we need when using our language in written form" <br><br>
                      Considering that this tool is bordering on 150 years in active service, surely there must be room for improvement? <br><br>
                      QWERTY is a real life relic from ancient times, this shit has been around since 1874. That is by modern standards an absolute dinosaur and I intend to hunt, and slay it and pray that I do it as masterfully as our beloved Aloy could.<br><br> 
                      Please, let's start using tools that are created with the ergonomics of an actual human in mind.<br><br>
                      <img src="/images/2_a.jpg" width="300px"><br>
                      The Azeron Keypads are a stroke of genius, once you realize the potential in having every button customizable together with layering and macros, you could configure a buttonset that works marvelous with all the Photoshop shortcuts but it would for instance be horrendous to use for typing. 
                      Another set for gaming of course and let me tell you, that having the joystick at your thumb is such a massive upgrade by itself. Instead of using three fingers to control your movement, now you use one, and one that is quite well suited for the job. This leaves the afformentioned three fingers free to focus on other tasks such as switching weapons, dodging, and shooting which instantly increases your skill level because all of a sudden, you aren't tripping with your fingers when trying to reach that stupid button for the mission specific item that you use 1/20 games.<br><br>
                      Still, it irks you, that feeling of knowing that you had the right idea, you just snagged your fat unruly pinky on the key next beside your intended target. <br><br>
                      It just makes sense, to move your fingers a shorter distance to hit the button but noone has figured out how to place those buttons to actually work in practicality, until now. <br>
                      <p class="exclamation">Ergonomics is your path to excellence!</p><br>
                      Being able to adjust the whole thing in almost all angles individually for all 5 fingers is in my opinion one of the most underrated and most brilliant finesse that comes with an Azeron. You can adjust them to both a wide margin and fine degree to make it suit YOUR hand. I will admit that this process can be quite frustrating and feel downright counter-productive in the beginning. For me, I was having trouble getting the thumbstick in a comfortable position which lead to my other fingers straining to compensate in some instances and left my hands in come weird crypto-cramp where my ringfinger would be just deadlocked straight.<br><br> 
                      The only advice I can offer at this stage of the setup is: patience. It can take up to a week or two before you get the thumbstick right, then when that feels acceptable you start focusing more on your other fingers and how you want those towers angled. So you fiddle a bit with that and all of a sudden the thumbstick feels off again so you repeat the madness.<br><p class="exclamation"> Patience!</p><br> I swear to you, the suffering will be worth it. 
                      When you start getting the hang of this thing you will realize that the people still using QWERTY-keyboards in 2022 is the real horrid madness. <br> <br>My objective is to assign all the letters and keys to the buttons on the keypad, the question is just: How? Assigning the letter B to any button on the device is a piece of cake thanks to the included software, the problem lies in deciding which letter goes to which button? For this task I'm using math to figure out which letters are encountered more often.  </p>

However, even better still is having to do no input at all, with motionsensors throughout the apartment I have automated every single light, both on and off sequences. Additionally, the motionsensors doubles as compatible devices within the security features of my smart home make me feel more at ease. It's amazing how accessible and affordable IoT devices have become, making it easier for me to turn my apartment into a smart home.</p>

                  <div class="info">
                    <p> While working with the students at school, together we discovered the annual initiative to "rock your socks" on the 21:st of March. This is done to raise awareness and promote acceptance of the condition and the individuals living with it. My students suggested that we as a class should participate in mixing up our socks, however on this day they decided to include not only Downs but all nerodivergent conditions like Autism or ADHD aswell. However to their dismay, they quickly realized that there already exists a "World Autism Day" a month later. This is where they decided to combine the two days and keep rocking their socks from 21st of March to the 2nd of April. At the time I was in addition to the teachers assistant also tasked with helping one student in particular who was diagnosed with Autism. <br>
                      Naturally I found their idea quite wholesome and decided to join them in mixing up my warddrobe. The very same night, by happenstance I encountered a small essay written by Richard Dawkins in which he encourages the very same behaviour but for entirely different reasons. This put me on a path which I still walk to this day and will continue to do so until my final days. I save untold amounts of time while also reminding myself and others that we are all different. <br></p>
